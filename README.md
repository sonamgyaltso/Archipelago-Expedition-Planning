# Archipelago-Expedition-Planning
Welcome to the paradise! You have traveled to a beautiful archipelagoin the Pacific Oceanand you are planning your great expedition. These group of remote islands are accessible with ferry rides.  Each island has a unique number. If there’s a ferry ride from Island X to Island Y, the network depicting the archipelago willhave an “edge” from X to Y. Below are a number of drawings representing this idea. Think about this drawing as maps available in the tavern of each island that will inform all touristshow to move between islands and plan their expedition.The islands are represented by a circle and the edges are represented by arrows.Consider the first drawing, this archipelago consists of 6 islands. It has a ferry ride between island 1to island 2. Island 3has three ferry rides going to island 3, island 4, and island 5. There are no ferry rides out of island 3or island 5so you have to be careful,you can get stuck there. Legend has it, the islands are so beautiful no one wants to leave after arriving (or maybe there’s a monster eating newly arrived tourists, I leave this to your imagination).There are two ferry rides leaving island 4for island 5and island 6. Finally, there’s one ferry ride leaving island 6for island 3.
